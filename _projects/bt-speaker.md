Combining the CSRA64215 Bluetooth Speaker module with some fancy speakers and tasteful woodworking, this project is intended to showcase simplicity and elegance.  Several variations of this portable speaker were designed, including a stained oak cube with a square speaker, and an oak laminate featuring rounded corners.  Both designs include a fully custom PCB and are completely wireless - including charging.  When using two of these speakers, they are able to communicate with each other so that one plays the left channel while the other plays the right, providing a truely wireless stereo experience.<!-- more -->

These speakers started as an "easy" project for the sake of completing a project in 2017.  The final goal was (and still is) to learn about the "True Wireless Stereo" feature present on the CSRA64215 IC and apply it to a much larger desktop speaker.
