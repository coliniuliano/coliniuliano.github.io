Designed to experiment with True Wireless Stereo technology, these speakers feature the CSRA62415 audio module and BMR12 drivers wrapped in a modern oak enclosure.  Engineered for high-quality audio in a small form-factor, the signal path remains digital from the Bluetooth/USB input to the amplifier output.  Pair two speakers together for fully wireless stereo sound.<!-- more -->

## Introduction ##
True Wireless Stereo technology enables two Bluetooth speakers to connect to each other and split the incoming audio signal into left and right channels.  In other words, TWS enables one speaker to act independently, or two speakers to pair together to provide completely wireless stereo sound.

This project was conceived because it touches on several different engineering challenges:  the woodworking needed to be visually appealing and tightly-integrated with the final electronics; the electronics needed to provide a high-quality audio signal and a strong Bluetooth connection; the firmware needed to ensure that a battery-pull is never required; and the overall design needed to look and sound incredible.  Many hours went into 3D modelling to ensure that the components would integrate tightly and still produce a crisp, deep sound.

## Hardware ##
The hardware for this project is quite simple since the CSRA64215 module is an all-in-one solution.  Most of the effort for this project went into messing around with all the poorly-documented configuration options available.  Many 2" speakers were tested for their sound quality to ensure that the final product is not limited by a cheap driver.

### Issues ###
While the speaker does currently work, some assumptions about low-power modes were incorrect (Boost Disable Shifter circuit).  As a result, the speaker does not properly disable the amplifier when not in use, leading to an idle current of around 30mA.  Revision 2 will address this sole remaining issue.

### Schematic ###
Warning: this schematic does not properly disable the amplifier during power-down.

## Woodworking ##
There are two variations of this speaker.  The round variation is made of 7 layers of MDF and covered with an oak laminate.  The rounded speaker did not turn out that nice, so it got scrapped.  The square variation is made of solid oak with contrasting espresso stain.  To ensure perfect fits, many templates were 3D-printed to assist with cutting.  Each speaker design was thoroughly 3D-modelled to guarantee adequate volume and seamless integration.
