Providing up to 15W of heat, these carbon fiber wrapped gloves were constructed to withstand and combat the harsh Canadian ski season.  A custom waterproof control box provides 3 levels of warming power for comfortable hands in any weather.<!-- more -->

## Introduction ##
Details coming soon.

## Hardware ##
While powered gloves are the main focus of this project, a control box was also built as a mechanism of monitoring battery levels and controlling output power.  The gloves expect to receive 12v power through a standard barrel jack, so they are perfectly suitable to be used without a power controller.  Alternatively, any standard 12v dimmer should work just fine.
