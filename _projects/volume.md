## Introduction ##
In early 2017, I purchased several new tools to start basic woodworking projects.  I also decided that I wanted to start documenting projects along with high fidelity 3d models and renderings.  The resulting project was a very simple volume knob that served as an educational tool in learning both new software and woodworking tools while providing an opportunity to design with space constraints.
